  m_Name: A4. Crutch after Grinder
  m_EditorClassIdentifier: 
  storyText: "You set the grinder down, now full of weed, ready to be in a joint.
    The first wave of blows have landed, and thankfully, they didn't do any serious
    damage yet. You grab one end of the crutch, and start folding it to make a M-shape
    fold, then with the remaining crutch that hasn't been folded, you start wrapping
    it around the M-shape fold. You make sure to roll it around the fold, then pull
    to tighten it. You keep repeating the process until you got a rolled filter with
    a M-Shape fold in the middle.\r\n\r\nAs you set the crutch down, now ready, a
    blow comes across your right cheek. It's a good shot, as you're a bit dizzy from
    the attack. What do you do?\r\n\r\nPress 1) Grab the rolling paper\r\nPress 2)
    Defend and attack back"
