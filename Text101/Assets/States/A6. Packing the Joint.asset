  storyText: "The rolling paper is loaded with the weed from the grind, with the filter
    on one end. You pinch the paper between your fingertips from both end, while still
    holding the paper horizontally towards you, and roll it back and forth to pack
    the cannabis down into a cone shape. A blow comes to your hand, and you almost
    drop the unfinished joint. However, through sheer will and the luck of destiny,
    you still manage to hold on. What do you do? \r\n\r\nPress 1) Roll the joint\r\nPress
    2) Defend and attack\r\n\r\n"
