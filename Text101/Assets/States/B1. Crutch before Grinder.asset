  storyText: "You grab the crutch you will use as the filter for your joint, and start
    rolling it. You grab one end of it, and start folding it to make a M-shape fold,
    then with the remaining crutch that hasn't been folded, you start wrapping it
    around the M-shape fold. You make sure to roll it around the fold, then pull to
    tighten it. You keep repeating the process until you got a rolled filter with
    a M-Shape fold in the middle. However, your brothers have started to move while
    you were rolling, and you feel the first blows land on your body. They aren't
    serious blows....yet. What do you do?\r\n\r\nPress 1) Grind the cannabis strain\r\nPress
    2) Defend and attack\r\n\r\n"
