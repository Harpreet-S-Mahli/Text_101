  storyText: "With the joint now being almost done, you take the pen that's in front
    of you, and start packing the open end of the joint, by pushing down the weed
    with the pen. Afterwards, you use the pen to stab a few of your brothers out of
    frustration. Now, you take the last bit of rolling paper that's left on the open
    end, and twist it to close off that end. You're almost finished with the test,
    now one last thing to do in this continuous storm of punches and kicks.\r\n\r\nPress
    1) Light the  joint\r\nPress 2) Defend and attack\r\n\r\n"
