  storyText: "You grab the cannabis and grinder, and start grinding up the weed into
    smaller bits so it's easier to roll later. As you start grinding, you notice from

    wave of attacks will hit you, what do you do?\r\n \r\nPress 1) Grab the crutch
    to make a filter\r\nPress 2) Defend and attack back"
