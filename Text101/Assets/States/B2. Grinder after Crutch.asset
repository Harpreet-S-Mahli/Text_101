  m_EditorClassIdentifier: 
  storyText: "The crutch is now ready to be used. As you set it down, blows continue
    to land on your body, but you focus. You grab the grinder, and start grinding
    up the cannabis strain that's provided. You can't roll a joint until the strain
    is into smaller bits. Now that that task is finished, you set the grinder down.
    Your body finally aches from the  blows to have landed. What do you do?\r\n\r\nPress
    1) Grab the rolling paper\r\nPress 2) Defend and attack\r\n\r\n"
