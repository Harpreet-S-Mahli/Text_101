  storyText: "Now the cannabis strain has been shredded into smaller bits, and the
    filter is created from the crutch. You now have all the basic components ready
    to start rolling the joint. You grab the rolling paper, and while holding it horizontally
    towards you, with one hand on one end, you place the crutch on the other end.
    While still holding the rolling paper from the opposite end of the crutch, you
    fold the paper slightly into a V-shape, and start filling its inside with the
    weed in the grinder. You continue diligently, while feeling blow after blow all
    over your body. What do you do?\r\n\r\nPress 1) Pack the joint\r\nPress 2) Defend
    and attack\r\n\r\n"
