  m_Name: A7. Rolling the Joint
  m_EditorClassIdentifier: 
  storyText: "The joint is now ready to be rolled. While still holding the rolling
    paper from both ends, you lick the top edge which has the glue on it, then tuck
    the unglued side into the roll. You roll it up with the unglued side on the inside,
    with the moist glued edge seals itself on one of the paper, creating a cone on
    one end. Once the paper was tacked down on one end, you start working your way
    down the rest of the seam by tucking and sealing the joint. Surprisingly, with
    all of the continuous blows you've felt, especially the ones on the hand, you
    didn't drop a single bit of weed inside the rolling paper. What do you do?\r\n\r\nPress
    1) Pack and finish the joint\r\nPress 2) Defend and attack\r\n\r\n"
