  storyText: "It suddenly hits you, why your master sighed. The point of the final
    exam is to show that you've mastered your body and mind. You knew that the mind
    was represented if you could roll the joint, but the body.... At first, you assumed
    it was if you could fight back, that would showcase you mastering the body. However,
    the true ordeal was to take the blows and continue to roll the joint, thus showing
    that your body and mind are communication to one another. With realizing that
    you've failed, you decide to finish attacking.\r\n\r\nPress 1) Finish what you
    started\r\n\r\n"
